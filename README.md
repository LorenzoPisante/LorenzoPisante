# Hi, I'm Lorenzo Pisante! ðŸ‘‹

I recently completed a Master's in Mathematical Engineering at Politecnico di Milano, specializing in Statistical Learning. I'm passionate about AI, machine learning, and data analysis, with a strong focus on ethical AI practices.

## Master's Thesis
- **CausalTimeSeriesML: A Comprehensive Analysis of Causal Inference in Time Series using Machine Learning**  
  My thesis presents an in-depth exploration of causal inference techniques applied to time series data using various machine learning models. It includes a thorough review of existing methodologies and the development of novel approaches to enhance causal inference in time-sensitive datasets.
  
## Projects
- **Bayesian Modeling of Milan Airbnb Prices**  
  Developed a Bayesian statistical model to analyze and predict the pricing of Airbnb listings in Milan. This project involved extensive data collection, model training, and evaluation using Python.
- **LangGraphGPT**  
  Worked on the development of a GPT-based system designed for enhancing language graph models. This project focuses on integrating GPT with graph-based architectures to optimize performance in natural language processing tasks. 

## Skills
- **Programming:** Python, R, Matlab, SQL, C, C++, JavaScript  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, scikit-learn
